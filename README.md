# Rust LinkedHashMap
LinkedHashMap implementation in Rust.

## About
This is certainly not the most efficient or *best* implementation; however, I'm
mainly just trying to learn rust docs, unit testing, and generics. The code I have now
should allow for reverse lookup by index in the future, so that's pretty cool.

## Getting Started
- [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Generate Documentation
- Run `cargo doc`
- Open `./target/doc/linkedhashmap/index.html` in a web browser

## Run Tests
`cargo test`

## TODO
- Make this even more non-standard and do reverse lookup by index?
- I would make this more standard, but an implementation for [a LinkedHashMap in Rust already exists](https://docs.rs/linked-hash-map/latest/linked_hash_map/).
